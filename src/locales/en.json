The goal is also to be able to easily orient the matching using a DSL (Domain Specific Language). The DSL present in this software makes it possible to write constraints that must be satisfied for a pair to be considered viable.",
    "p2": "Thus the ultimate goal of this software is to allow focusing on the matching policy and to launch a matching algorithm which will respect this policy. Once launched, the matching is done in a few seconds where a manual matching would take several hours.",
    "title2": "Prepare the data",
    "p3": "Each mentee and mentor table must be imported in CSV format and with a semicolon separator. Each table must be encoded in UTF-8 format. If you're having trouble encoding your data tables from Excel, here's what to do.",

    "title3": "Write constraints",
    "p4": "The constraints are constructed as follows:",
    "li8": "There are two key words: \"mentee\" and \"mentor\"",
    "li9": "To refer to a column found in the mentee table and whose name is for example \"Column 1\", you must write \"mentee.COLONNE_1\". The column name is slightly changed for DSL: all letters are uppercase and spaces are replaced by an underscore.",
    "li10": "You can then use comparison operators to write your first constraint: mentee.AGE <mentor.AGE",
    "li11": "You can also use logical and computational operators to make your constraint more complex: mentee.AGE <mentor.AGE and mentee.JOB_LEVEL + 2 <mentor.JOB_LEVEL",
    "li12": "The comparison operators are: <, <=,>,> =, =, not (ie is not equal to)",

    "p5": "You can rename and save your project. By convention, a project whose name is \"My mentoring project\" will be saved in the form \"mon_projet_de_mentoring.bmatch\", the bmatch extension is specific to this software.",
    "p6": "To save your current project make sure to dedicate a folder to it on your computer and save regularly to this location."
